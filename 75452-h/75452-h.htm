<p class="ph3"><i>The Sciences Converge</i></p>


<p>One of the most fascinating features
in the history of thought is that on
several occasions an important new idea
has come simultaneously to independent
minds. Thus after Euclid’s geometry
had remained without a rival for two
thousand years the conception of an
alternative non-Euclidean system was
reached separately by Gauss, Lobatschewsky,
and Bolyai during the years
1820-30. Bolyai’s father, while ignorant
of the fact that Gauss had already made
the same discoveries, wrote to his son
urging him to publish his results and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>used the following prophetic words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is some truth in this, that
many things have an epoch, in which
they are found at the same time in several
places, just as the violets appear on every
side in the spring.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another example of the simultaneous
emergence of an idea in the minds of
different thinkers is given by Darwin
in his introduction to the <i>Origin of
Species</i>. He there calls attention to the
fact that in 1794-5 the broad idea of the
evolution of species—though not its
cause—was simultaneously formulated by
Goethe in Germany, St Hilaire in France,
and his own grandfather, Dr Darwin,
in England. Moreover Darwin himself
had the remarkable experience of finding
in an essay submitted to him in 1858
by A. R. Wallace a complete summary
of his own unpublished theory of natural
selection as the chief cause of the evolution
of species.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>The last few years constitute another
critical period of a similar kind, since
an idea, which when made precise will
transform scientific thought, has already
come independently to many thinkers.
Since 1922 many scientists have felt
that in studying the emission and absorption
of light physics has come near
to the problem of life.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Others have
proposed that in order to straighten
out its atomic problems physics will
have to take a hint from biology, but
what this hint should be has not yet
been indicated. The following pages
suggest a definite line of advance for
physics, and interpret these isolated
flashes of intuition as evidence of a
special feature in the present situation
of the sciences.</p>

<p>We stand at the eve of a new epoch.
Physics, biology, and psychology are
converging towards a scientific synthesis
of unprecedented importance, whose
influence on thought and social custom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>will be so profound that it will mark a
stage in human evolution. For centuries
science has concentrated its highest
genius on the study of inanimate matter;
to-day the three great sciences are at
last reaching the problem of life. For
their researches on matter, life, and mind
are now overlapping at one common
issue: the nature of the fundamental
electrical processes which underlie radiation
and chemical combination.</p>

<p>Thus physics is at present occupied
with the changes that occur when an
atom emits either light or electricity.
Biology is at the same problem in studying
the electrical processes which are the
basis of all organic behaviour, whether
in primitive forms of protoplasm or in
the highly developed central nervous
system of man. Meantime psychology
is dealing with an identical process when
it analyses the structure of mind, and
considers the elementary changes of
consciousness which are produced when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>light of a given colour falls on the
retina and sends its influence to the
brain.</p>

<p>As the result of these convergent
researches, life and consciousness will
soon be subject to the first stages of a
theoretically-grounded control, compared
with which the present tentative efforts
of medicine and psychology will be
looked back on much as we remember
the haphazard work of the alchemists
before the foundation of chemistry. But
this development of human knowledge
and powers will carry with it great
responsibilities, and scientists have to
prepare themselves for the new tasks
that will very soon fall to them. By
indicating the main ideas through which
this broad scientific synthesis may come
about, this essay aims at showing that
this possibility has to be taken seriously.
We shall first examine the situation in
physics and then turn to consider the
influence which future developments of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>physical theory may have on biology
and psychology.</p>

<p>Two main types of process defy interpretation
within the present scheme of
physical conceptions: life itself, and the
atomic processes of radiation and the
building up of stable compounds. In
organic processes on the one hand, and
the energy-interchanges of atoms on
the other hand, we find something happening
which cannot adequately be explained
as a change in the <i>structure</i> of the system
considered. By structure is meant a
spatial pattern of particles, which are
supposed to be permanent and to move
about like cricket balls or planets.
Systems with a structure of this kind
could not display the purposive quality
of organic behaviour, and when we try
to make a structural model of the atom
we find that it fails to explain why the
atom radiates energy in the abrupt
packets which are called ‘quanta’,
instead of in a continuous wave. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>shall return presently to the question
of organisms, after making an endeavour
to discover why the atom cannot be
described in terms of a particle structure.</p>

<p>In 1911 Rutherford achieved remarkable
success in accounting for the results
of his own researches in radioactivity
by adopting a model of the atom as a
miniature solar system, with planetary
electrons rotating rapidly around a
nucleus. But in order to explain the
fact that the spectrum of the light
emitted by an atom shows a characteristic
series of lines, Bohr suggested that
an electron inside an atom could emit
light only by making a discontinuous
jump from one possible orbit to another
quite distinct orbit. This apparent
discontinuity in the motion of electrons
has intrigued physicists for more than
ten years, and the following interpretations
have recently been offered for this
puzzling behaviour:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Nature is made up of electrons,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>but neither space nor time is fundamentally
discontinuous. The electron appears to
have some freedom of choice, and to be
able to reappear unexpectedly at forbidden
places.</p>

<p>2. Nature is not discontinuous or
arbitrary, but nevertheless something
prevents us determining all the things
we should like to know about an electron.
For instance, if we try to determine
exactly where it is, it behaves so that we
cannot simultaneously measure its exact
velocity. (Heisenberg.) This view may
perhaps be interpreted to mean that we
have made the atom model more complex
than the atom itself is, and that consequently
we have been using more
quantities than are necessary for
describing all we can observe of its
behaviour.</p>

<p>3. Nature is not made up of electrons,
but of waves. The atom must be considered
as a system of electric waves
spread over its whole volume. ‘Electrons’
are merely an inaccurate way of describing
some of the properties of these
waves. The wave picture of the atom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>is, however, to be considered only as a
temporary expedient to be used until
some better description of the atom can
be invented, in which both the wave
and the corpuscular properties of atoms
will appear as aspects of some more
profound physical property. (Schrödinger.)</p>
</div>

<p>The first alternative is a mere cry of
despair, since it does not propose any
line of advance. But the other two
suggestions may be combined thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4. The view of the atom as a structure
of Newtonian particles is wrong since
it gives rise to discontinuities, and provides
more quantities than we at present
need. A new formulation of atomic
processes must be found using fewer
quantities which will explain why we
find wave properties, and why sometimes
the electron does behave like a small
billiard ball though really it is some
different sort of thing.</p>
</div>

<p>Now since the Newtonian mathematics
of moving particles is inadequate for
describing the changes that go on in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>atom—just as it is for describing organic
processes—there must be some assumption
implicit in Newton’s laws which is valid
neither for atom nor for organism. Such
an assumption can be found very easily,
though physics has never given it much
attention. It is that the elementary
processes in nature are <i>reversible</i>, or
would be if they could be isolated. By
reversible is here meant that the laws
governing the process remain unchanged
when the direction of time is reversed,
i.e. when -t is substituted for +t. If the
law is changed by this substitution so that
the reversed process never occurs or is
recognizably different, then the process
is called irreversible. An irreversible
process can therefore be used to yield an
objective criterion of past and future,
when these terms have been once defined.</p>

<p>To take an example. If I am standing
behind a hedge and take a cinematograph
film of a stone which suddenly rises in
the air and disappears from sight, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>could not tell from an examination of
the film which way to wind it. Thus if
it is wound one way the stone appears
to rise, and if wound the other way
to fall from the sky. To tell which was
the right way I should have to use my
subjective sense of the direction of time,
i.e. remember the fact that I saw the stone
low in the air before I saw it high up.
This case, like every gravitational process,
is reversible, and motions of this kind
have provided the basis for modern
physical conceptions.</p>

<p>But suppose that instead I had taken
a film of a cup of tea as it was cooling.
One end of the film would show the
steam above the cup and the spoon
changing in length as it changed in
temperature. Passing along the film
these effects would grow less marked until
the successive photos showed no variation
when the temperature of the tea
was nearly that of the surrounding air.
It would be obvious which way to wind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>this film, without using any subjective
criterion supplied from memory of the
individual process which had been photographed.
This process is irreversible,
but physics has hitherto assumed that
all such processes are merely the statistical
result of a chaos of molecular motions
each of them perfectly reversible.</p>

<p>The assumption of reversibility seems
to some physicists so fundamental that
they think there could be no science
without it. But that is a mere prejudice
arising from the fact that Newton
conceived one particular way of giving
mathematical formulation to the measurable
features of physical processes. By
suggesting that all the laws of nature
might take a form similar to his law of
gravitation, he made the implicit assumption
that all elementary processes were
reversible. Gravitational motions are
so, at any rate within the accuracy of
Newton’s law, and as a consequence of
the confirmation of his law and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>fact that it has been taken as a model
for the whole system of modern physical
conceptions, the latter are only appropriate
for reversible processes.</p>

<p>Apparent irreversibility, such as the
cooling of a cup of tea, is attributed to
statistical effects, and the second law
of thermodynamics, which asserts that
temperatures tend to uniformity, is
treated as merely a statement of what is
highly probable. This is probably quite
legitimate, but even where no statistical
effect can enter and the process is clearly
irreversible physics usually adopts any
measure rather than assume that a
fundamental elementary process is
irreversible.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> We cannot be surprised at
this, since if physics once admitted
that any elementary process was irreversible
it would have to give up the
whole system of Newtonian conceptions.
Matter, force, energy, action, and wave
properties are all unsuitable for the
treatment of irreversible effects since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>they all ultimately depend on Newton’s
reversible law.</p>

<p>An entirely new set of ideas is necessary
for describing processes which necessarily
proceed in one direction, so that one
particular state of the system must
precede another state. It appears conceivable
that an alternative set of
conceptions to replace the Newtonian
might be established by demanding the
irreversibility of all natural laws, as
well as the demands hitherto made
by physics, i.e. the permanence of matter
and the conservation of energy.</p>

<p>The question of the reversibility of
natural processes provides the key to
a great intellectual struggle which is
now in progress behind the complexities
of philosophic and scientific thought.
The issue can be formulated thus:</p>

<p>Is there a real temporal process in
nature? Is the passage of irreversible time
a necessary element in any view of the
structure of nature? Or, alternatively,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>is the subjective experience of time a
mere illusion in the mind which cannot
be given objective expression? These
are not metaphysical questions that can
still be neglected by science with impunity.
For just as Einstein made his advance
by analysing conceptions such as simultaneity,
which had been thought to be
adequately understood for the purposes
of empirical science, so the next development
of physical theory will probably
be made by carrying on the analysis of
time from the point at which Einstein
left it. Moreover, the above questions
may be put into precise scientific form
by asking if the causal relations which
are studied by science are symmetrical
and reversible so that we cannot obtain
from them any criterion by which to
distinguish past and future. If, on the
other hand, they are asymmetrical and
irreversible, the laws of nature lead us
on necessarily from what went before to
what comes afterwards.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>A modern duel: Einstein and Eddington
v. Bergson and Whitehead</i></p>


<p>In this battle over the importance
of time and process great names stand
out as representatives of the two opposed
views: Einstein and Bergson, with
their lieutenants, Eddington and Whitehead.
The two leaders use very different
methods. Einstein, as mathematical
physicist, suggests that physical laws
can best be expressed if we assume that
space and time are so similar that physics
can make no absolute distinction between
them. Thus in relativity theory the
symmetry of space involves the symmetry
of time, and therefore the reversibility
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>of physical laws, as has been shown
by Birkhoff. Bergson, as biologist and
philosopher, denies that the view of time
which is implicit in relativity mathematics
is adequate when a wider range
of experience is taken into account.</p>

<p>Einstein starts by excluding all but
a very narrow range of physical experience,
and finds that he can make successful
predictions about light and gravitation
by treating the irreversibility of the
passage of time as of no importance for
scientific measurements. Bergson, by
studying a wide range of biological and
subjective experience, comes to assert
the existence of a creative process, though
the inherent limitations of the intellect
and of science may leave the essence of
this process outside their reach.</p>

<p>Both protagonists have left their
flanks exposed, by omitting to present
their view as a consistent logical system,
Einstein because he is concerned only
with the equations that can be empirically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>tested, and Bergson because his chief
interest is non-intellectual. It is here
that their lieutenants step forward to
develop the two points of view, and
hence to intensify the conflict.</p>

<p>Eddington provides a logical basis for
the theory of relativity and reveals
that the significance of physical laws is
not quite what we used to think. They
are, he argues, identities which the human
mind discovers in its search for something
permanent that it can call <i>matter</i> beneath
all the changing appearances of the world.
We have made matter the real thing
by demanding permanence or indestructibility
as the basis of physical reality.
Now that we know that we have done
this it need not trouble us too much to
find that absolute unchanging matter
doesn’t exist, since this merely means
that we started out with a demand
that nature cannot fulfil. Unfortunately
Eddington doesn’t discuss what alternative
demand we might now make in order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>to build up a more satisfactory system
of scientific ideas. But in spite of his
enthusiastic support of Einstein’s theory,
with its implicit assumption of reversibility,
Eddington hesitates at least once
in his advocacy of reversible laws, for
facts are turning up which suggest that
this undiscussed presupposition may not
prove valid.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Meantime Whitehead has been at
work on the other side, and by sharpening
his logic till few can understand him
has made the idea of temporal process
the basis of all intellectual and scientific
thought, whereas up to now process has
always presented many difficult problems
for the intellect. He proposes that
since the conception of matter has been
found to be unsatisfactory we must
start from the basic idea of process in
building up a new physical theory.
As a consequence of his line of thought,
Whitehead found it necessary to reject
some of Einstein’s arguments and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>show that Einstein’s law could be reached
from quite different postulates. For
instance, Whitehead assumed that the
motion of light was irreversible, and
that light did not travel with the same
velocity in the two opposed directions.</p>

<p>So much for one aspect of the conflict,
its logical and philosophical basis. But
the issue must be decided by appeal to
experimental confirmation over the widest
range of phenomena. Orthodox physics
still assumes reversibility, and has on its
side the explicit statement made by Einstein
in 1925,<a href="#Page_96" class="ofnanchor">[4]</a> but by doing so it excludes
at the start any reference to organic
processes. Conceptions based on this
assumption could never be legitimately
applied to life, and all attempts made
hitherto to explain the central controlling
processes of organisms in terms of classical
physics have necessarily failed. We
know now that this failure could have been
foreseen.</p>

<p>The same objection cannot be made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>against the basic ideas of Bergson and
Whitehead, nor against the new atomic
physics as interpreted by Born, as we shall
see in a moment. To Bergson and Whitehead,
as to many others amongst whom
Lloyd Morgan must be mentioned, the
process of nature is creative, i.e. it involves
the coming into being of the new, the appearance
of new combinations essentially
precluded before. This probably means
that the laws of physics which are to
describe what is actually happening in
the world must be given irreversible
form. For reversible equations make no
distinction between to-day and to-morrow,
and cannot express the fact that at later
moments new forms may emerge, either
in the evolution of organisms or of stars.
On the other hand irreversible laws can
be arranged so as to display time as an
active factor in causation, i.e. to emphasize
the fact that a certain period of
time necessarily has to pass before some
new combination can be attained.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<p>The upholders of a real process in nature
can appeal to the facts of organic life,
human memory, and to biological and
stellar evolution. But their case is still
weak because fundamental irreversibility
has not yet received explicit mathematical
formulation suitable for experimental
test. When this has been done
the intellectual battle will be brought
to its decision, and if irreversibility
wins the day biology and psychology
will find themselves in possession of a
physical basis well suited to the facts
with which they have to deal.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the
decision will be made very soon. We saw
that the implicit assumption of reversibility
underlies all Newtonian conceptions.
It may therefore be that the reason why
we cannot interpret atomic behaviour in
terms of particle motions is that electrical
and radiational processes are essentially
irreversible. Particle motion and wave
propagation—the two ideas on which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>all modern theories of matter are based—are
both represented by mathematical expressions
which are essentially reversible
since time enters only through the
square of ‘dt’. If the quantum processes
should prove to be irreversible,
we have already found a reason why the
old conceptions of particles and waves
must be inadequate.</p>

<p>This speculation may indeed be found
correct, since Born, one of the leading
experts in Quantum Dynamics, asserts
that all quantum processes are
irreversible and that the apparent
reversibility of classical processes is
only an approximation due to the fact
that their irreversibility happens to be
negligible.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We may therefore hope that
the atomic physicists will soon formulate
the quantum laws in a clearly irreversible
form which admits of precise experimental
test.</p>

<p>But this may take some years, and in
the meantime we must look around and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>see how this issue is affecting current
thought. We find the doubt about
process presented by Mr Sullivan (in
<i>Gallio</i>), who has not yet made up his
mind to which side science will grant
the victory. Thus on one page he writes:
“it seems to be true that events do not
really take place, we come across them”
and suggests that process may be “a
totally irrelevant idea when applied to
reality”. But later we learn to our
surprise that “it seems likely that (in
scientific theory) the world will have
to be regarded as an evolutionary process,
where patterns of value emerge”. However,
this inconsistency need not bother
us, since we are told that “the teachings
of science so far as the spiritual problems
of man are concerned are merely
irrelevant”.</p>

<p>These views reflect perfectly the uncertainty
of the time, and will be looked
back on as a precious record of the state
of mind which preceded the scientific
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>synthesis. Perhaps the most interesting
feature of the essay is the indecision it
displays with regard to the spiritual
importance of science. This is a relic
from the days when there were two worlds,
the world of science and the world of religion
and art. No one ever knew which
of these worlds they were living in, and
this is no wonder. For the division was
made only because at one time it looked
as though the scientific method could
only deal with <i>quantities</i>, and therefore
that science could have nothing to say
about values or qualities. This view is
no longer tenable. For instance, there is
a quality in organic integration which
most of us value, and without this and
many other such conceptions biology
and psychology could not get far.</p>

<p>Before proceeding any further it is
necessary to correct a common misunderstanding
with regard to the significance
of Einstein’s theory of relativity.
This theory is mathematical, and is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>based on a series of postulates which
rule out any claim to present an ultimate
theory of space and time. One of these
postulates<a href="#Page_96" class="ofnanchor">[6]</a> asserts that all our physical
knowledge can be reduced to the space-time
coincidences of pairs of point-events,
or in other words the intersection of the
world-lines of electrons. No respect for
the supreme genius who predicted two
experimental results and eliminated the
chief discrepancies remaining in Newtonian
theory should restrain scientists
from pointing out that this postulate
assumes something that has never been
known to occur, and has no valuable
reference to the world of physical experiment.
The confirmation of Einstein’s
final equations cannot give any validity
to this postulate. For it is difficult to think
of any physical experience considered
by theoretical physics which does not
involve the perception of light or colour,
and one cannot assume that the perception
of light is a perception of coincidences.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>Light varies in colour and intensity;
coincidence in space is too abstract to
account for an effect which is subject
to variation. Moreover all physical
experience requires a certain amount of
time, and this fact is neglected if perception
is reduced to the recognition of
instantaneous coincidences. Even if these
two criticisms are left on one side we still
have to notice that Einstein’s postulate
rules out from the range of physics the
important fact that many processes are
irreversible. For instance, if we accept
Einstein’s definition of physical experience,
then the interesting fact that radioactivity
is only observed in the form of
disintegration, and not also as the reverse
process of a spontaneous building up of
heavier elements from lighter, has to be
left over by physics to be dealt with by
some other science.</p>

<p>It almost always happens that the
formulations of genius are exaggerated
and form the basis of a pernicious orthodoxy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>and it has certainly happened to
relativity theory. Against a tide of
exaggerated praise Whitehead, Larmor,
and Bridgman, as well as some Continental
astronomers, have debated the general
assumption that the theory of relativity
is adequate to its task, but those in whose
hands the power of orthodoxy lies have not
yet answered their criticisms in print.
Neglect has always been the weapon by
which orthodoxy has unknowingly
hindered the advance of new ideas. But
while this neglect is easy to understand,
it is really remarkable that the postulates
of relativity theory were not subjected to
closer examination before it was made the
basis of wide philosophical speculation.
The experimental confirmation of Einstein’s
law of gravitation does not
guarantee his postulates, since Whitehead
has reached a similar law (identical
within the accuracy of the observations)
from different assumptions.</p>

<p>Einstein’s profound creative intuition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>and use of a difficult technique compel
our deepest respect, but his work should
never have been regarded as a <i>general</i>
theory of time and space. Not only does
he neglect the question of irreversibility
but it is very doubtful if periodic processes
can be made to fit into his scheme, as
has been pointed out by Russell and
Bridgman during the last year. Probably
Einstein himself has never regarded his
theory as more than a stage in the attempt
to create a still wider physical synthesis,
and we must not interpret in a broad
sense his statement that one of the
demands of his theory “takes away from
space and time the last remnant of physical
objectivity”.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This could only be true if
physical time shared the absolute
symmetry of space, i.e. if physical processes
were all reversible. But there are
processes from which we can obtain an
objective criterion of the direction of
time, and hence time does retain an
element of physical objectivity as distinct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>from the absolute symmetry of space.
One of the most interesting features in
the future of physics will be the explanation
of the fact that Einstein reached a
correct law from postulates of limited
validity, and in this connection Whitehead’s
alternative derivation may prove
to be of importance.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Time in Astronomy and Physics</i></p>


<p>The real discrepancy between the world
of physics and that of life lies in the fact
that physics has never recognized the
irreversibility of time, while this is fundamental
to life. We may even feel a doubt
if the ‘t’ of physics has the same significance
as the time of biology, evolution,
history, and human experience. The
physical conception of time arose from
the practical utility of clocks for describing
natural processes, and finally took the
form of defining astronomical time in
terms of the rotation of the earth. The
day was in fact taken as an absolute
measure of time, and this remained quite
satisfactory so long as the laws of physics
were found to take a simple form with
reference to the time so defined.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>
<p>But then a complication arose. The
study of the moon’s motion suggested to
astronomers that the earth’s rotation
was slowing down, i.e. to account for the
apparent motion of the moon they had
to assume that the day was increasing in
length. The theory of the tides revealed
a possible cause for this slowing down
in the tidal friction on the bottom of
shallow water basins, for instance the
rush of the Atlantic tides into the Irish
Sea provides an appreciable frictional
force retarding the spin of the earth. In
addition to this slowing down there appears
to be a very slow periodic variation in
the length of the day such as would be
accounted for by a rhythmic expansion
and contraction of the earth’s crust.</p>

<p>The astronomers declare that our old
measure of time is not only getting slower
and slower, it is even varying rhythmically!
It is clear that they have thrown over the
earth as their definition of equal time
intervals and have surreptitiously substituted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>something else. Yet one cannot
discover any formal announcement of
this, or find out if they realize that by
doing this they have altered the theoretical
significance of all physical measurements.
In earlier days physics defined time in
terms of a selected clock, and then set
about finding the laws of nature. But
the old ways aren’t good enough for the
modern astronomer who gives us our
time and sets the clocks of our physical
laboratories. He has reasons for disapproving
of the earth, and has almost
reversed the procedure. In order to save
the laws of inertia and gravitation in
connection with the moon’s motion—and
to a lesser degree in the cases of the
planets and the sun—he has made these
laws his standard of equal time intervals
in place of the earth’s rotation.</p>

<p>It is a curious situation, especially in
view of the fact that Einstein’s law, which
has superseded Newton’s, is not very
suitable for use as an astronomical clock,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>as has been pointed out by Larmor.
Perhaps the physicist will soon be able
to use the atom as the theoretical clock
for physics, and we can go on using the
corrected rotation of the earth as our
practical standard. There is a faint
chance, for instance, that if physics can
invent some way of measuring the minute
time intervals along the track of an
electron, then electrons might be used
as giving the fundamental measure of
time. Thus if the velocity of an electron
were first measured by some indirect
method the electron itself might then
be used as a clock. But in the meantime
the astronomers should make a formal
announcement to the Royal Society of
what they have been up to. It then
might be found necessary to appoint
a commission to discover exactly what
physics is now doing. For by using an
astronomical clock of the new type it
is assuming classical laws while researching
on processes which are already known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>to undermine the absolute validity of
these laws. Theoretical physics cannot
hope to clear up its fundamental problems
until it has considered exactly what
is involved in this suspicious procedure.</p>

<p>Like most professions, physics includes
a good deal of bluff, but unlike the others
physics is now occupied on a campaign
to get rid of all pretence. For instance,
physical text-books have been filled for
twenty years with phrases of this kind:
“an electron with a velocity of so many
cms per sec.” Yet the professors omitted
to tell their students the awful secret that
this hypothesis of electron velocities is
one that has never yet received direct
experimental confirmation. To-day a
reaction has set in and the demand is
being made that physical theory shall not
make use of conceptions that do not
correspond to directly observed quantities.
Thus the latest theories of the
atom have eliminated the idea of electron
orbits because it was realized that these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>were nothing more than a mathematical
trick for calculating something quite
different: the wave-length of the light
an atom can emit. In place of the orbits
it is hoped to substitute something which
only makes use of the directly-observed
features of the atom, but this new picture
is not complete.</p>

<p>Yet physics still makes use of ideas
that have not been adequately justified.
For though the idea of moving electrons
has been removed from the latest atomic
model, no substitute for it has yet been
proposed for the case of electrons outside
the atom. It therefore becomes very
important for the experimental physicist
to discover whether he can measure the
distance travelled by an electron in a
measured fraction of a second. As yet
we have no proof that nature has not
confused us by making electrons behave
rather like moving particles, though
really they are something different. In
fact we have not yet made enough direct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>experiments to know even whether the
dimensional system which is used for
electrons is correct. Since no electron
velocity has ever been directly measured
we cannot be sure that the dimensions
of the new constant ‘h’—called Planck’s
constant—are really what we suppose,
energy multiplied by time. Until a
way has been invented of making a
direct measurement of some <i>time</i> involved
in electronic motions, it is impossible for
physical theory to know how it should
deal with the quantum processes.</p>

<p>When we realize how uncertain are the
conceptions on which the whole of electron
theory is based, we may wonder what is
really known about the atom itself. Yet
it is possible that we know more about the
atom than we think, and that what are
talked about as facts concerning electrons
and radiation may really be better viewed
as information about individual atoms
and the way in which they influence
one another. The emission of light is an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>atomic process, and we only know about
light when it has reached some atom
and been at least partially absorbed.
Some un-understood change of condition
occurs in an atom when it radiates and
passes this changed condition on to
another atom. The absorbed energy
may cause chemical change, as on a
photographic plate. But if a human mind
is to become aware of this change of
condition, then sooner or later, directly
or indirectly, its influence must be passed
on to an atom in the retina. We know
very little about this change of atomic
condition, and though it is usually called
a change of the internal electrical energy
of the atom this supposes more than we
really know until some electron velocity
has been directly measured. The dimensions
of electrical energy are taken as
those of kinetic energy, i.e. mass times
square of velocity, but we do not yet
know if this describes atomic changes
correctly. Since no one has ever measured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>a <i>time</i> involved in an electronic process, the
scale of time in the atom might be quite different
from that given by our calculations.</p>

<p>Our ignorance of what this change of
atomic condition really signifies is so
profound that some writers have begun
to treat the atom as though it were an
organism, alive when the atom is excited,
and dead when in a state of minimum
energy. Thus Whitehead proposes that
we should call the atom an organism,
though this of course may only muddle
us since we know even less about
life than we do about the atom.</p>

<p>Yet we do know one very interesting
thing about this change which happens
to atoms but cannot be reduced to a
change of structure. When light reaches
an atom in the retina, an electrical
stimulus passes up a nerve and alters
the condition of the protoplasm somewhere
in the brain. This change in brain condition
is known to us directly as the
perception of colour. Therefore in one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>sense we know more about this change
of atomic condition than we ever did
about ‘electric fields’ or ‘gravitational
potential’ or any other of the mathematical
conveniences used by physics in
correlating observed quantities. The
change in a sodium atom when we put
salt in a flame is not a change in the
consciousness of the sodium atom, because
it is not part of a complex nervous system
with the same high co-ordination as is
found in the human being, and therefore
the atom has no consciousness. But
when an atom in the brain undergoes the
same change we may become conscious
of it, and the changes in matter which
occur when light is absorbed are undoubtedly
associated with the problem of
consciousness.</p>

<p>Thus we are led to ask: how are single
atoms built up into complex systems which
have the characteristics of life, and
finally into still more complex systems
which have human consciousness?</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>An Evolutionary Experiment</i></p>


<p>Questions are often made unnecessarily
difficult by their being expressed
in an abstract or theoretical form, and
instead of asking What is life? it will be
more valuable to put forward a practical
issue for discussion: Could an infinitely
wise physicist order the necessary
chemicals to-day, and to-morrow put
together a synthetic man? If not, why
not? What are we really up against,
that seems to put some aspects of life
beyond our control?</p>

<p>Let us watch this ambitious physicist
as he enters his laboratory. He has
started quite easily and has in a moment
prepared some simple molecules from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>their elements. Now he has completed
the first colloid that he will require,
and is starting on his first organic synthesis.
But his infinite wisdom does
not give him eternity within a minute,
and we notice that he is getting on more
slowly. While the actual combination
of the first molecules took only about
a thousandth of a second, once he had the
apparatus ready, the simplest colloid
took about a second. The organic colloid
has taken him about a minute; it seems
that nature won’t work faster than that.
She has her own rhythm and won’t be
rushed. If we wait patiently till the
end of the day our friend may have his
first speck of protoplasm, and all the
skill in the world would only have helped
him to make more of it, not to have got
any further in his game of evolution.</p>

<p>But look at him now! He is making
a hasty calculation as though he had
just realized some great secret of
nature, and knew that he could never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>create his homunculus. We look over
his shoulder and read:</p>

<p>This highly speculative estimate is
based on suggestive facts. A certain
amount of time is necessary for two
atoms to approach one another and form
a molecule. The time required will be
greater if many atoms have to settle
down together into some special arrangement.
For instance, the metal silver is
normally crystalline, but if silver vapour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>is condensed too quickly the atoms will
not have time to arrange themselves, and
it is found that they pile up anyhow into
an amorphous mass.</p>

<p>Colloidal processes require even longer
periods, because great clumsy molecules
have to arrange themselves on the surface
of the colloidal particles. In elementary
forms of protoplasm the molecular patterns
are still more complex, and yet
more time must be necessary to get the
molecules properly adjusted.</p>

<p>It is probable that only our ignorance
prevents us from building up protoplasm,
but that we shall require rapidly increasing
amounts of time for each successive
stage of evolution. This will certainly
be the case when we have reached organisms
which can only be rendered more
complex by controlling their environment
while they reproduce themselves for many
generations. A higher organism cannot
be built up directly; the molecular
arrangements in its body can only be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>reached through the synthesis of some
simple form of life which must then be
allowed to evolve through countless generations.
Organic heredity resides in molecular
patterns which can only be built
up by this very slow process of repeated
reproduction. Thus it is <i>shortage of time</i>
that our ambitious scientist is up against
in his haste to create a homunculus.
Only the synthetic alchemy of time can
build up organisms, each bearing within
itself a long heredity.</p>

<p>The estimates given for the minimum
time required in each case are about a
thousandth of the actual time taken in a
laboratory experiment or in the history
of evolution as known from geological
records. It may have taken a million
years or more for the first mobile cells
to have developed from inorganic materials
and a thousand million years for the
mammals. Yet perhaps these processes
might have gone on more quickly. The
times given are mere suggestions of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>minimum time which may be necessary
under ideal conditions. We waste a lot
of time adjusting the apparatus in a
laboratory experiment, and in evolution
there may have been stationary periods
with little or no new development. But
it seems likely that when we know more
about it we shall discover that a certain
time is required for the formation of
organic systems of given complexity. In
this sense we may say that then human
spermatozoon and ovum carry within
them the synthesis of at least a million
years.</p>

<p>Only an International Institute of
Evolutionary Research under the most
stable of Leagues of Nations could hope
to create an artificial man, and even
then man could hardly take the credit,
for Time would have done more than
man. But with sufficient consistency
of purpose man could do this, provided
he learnt how to make use of every
moment of the creative power of time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>and never made a slip by which the
accumulated treasure of the years (i.e.
heredity) might be broken. How man
would learn to value life, and how profoundly
such an experiment might alter
his view of human beings, each one a
priceless miracle, fruit of a million years!</p>

<p>In twenty years’ time scientific knowledge
will be adequate for the beginning
of this giant task, and we shall be
subscribing our guineas for the foundation
of the Institute. Time has created
man; man may use time to create man
once more. With a million years ahead
of us before we reach the sensitive
mammals, we need hardly fear criticism
from the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. We are simply
going to allow life to evolve itself under
ideal conditions with Switzerland as the
State for Evolutionary Research.</p>

<p>It may happen that under such perfect
conditions life will evolve more swiftly
than it did on this rough-and-ready
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>planet. But equally well we—or rather
our descendants—may find that the
Darwinian struggle for survival is essential
for evolution, and then the nations
would have to debate on the morals of
reproducing the ‘cruelty of nature’
inside the World’s Evolutionary Zoo.
Perhaps a wrathful god will seek to
punish mankind for attempting to build
this ladder to the secret of life, this
modern Tower of Babel, and amuse himself
by watching the community of scientists
stricken by a plague of inconsistency
amongst their weights and measures.</p>

<p>The possibilities of such grand schemes
have to be taken seriously. We are now
highly self-conscious beings with a tremendous
technique for research. Men
with genuine creative imagination who
reverence life must shoulder the responsibilities
of the twentieth-century consciousness,
and use scientific technique
for creative not life-destroying purposes.
One can imagine a growing fraction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>the interest now given to war, other
people’s adultery, and greyhound racing,
turned towards Switzerland, whence at
critical moments wireless bulletins would
announce that the first amoeba had just
successfully taken nourishment. If we
wish it, the future of science can be
such as to recompense for its recent
occupation with gunpowder. Governments
would be powerless to make war
if the physicists refused to make the
guns and the Royal Society called upon
scientists to go on strike until each war
crisis had been settled by arbitration.</p>

<p>The problem of life may be seen in a
new light if the speculations of the last
section are accepted and we assume that
a definite period of time is necessary for
the building up of any living organism.
For if this is so the laws which govern
life must involve the age of the organism
since some definite moment in its history.
We might choose for this moment the
instant when the parent spermatozoon
entered the ovum in the case of a higher
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>organism, or in the evolutionary experiment
just described the age might be
reckoned from the moment when the
first elementary chemicals were combined
into molecules. The point is that this
whole evolutionary process must be
described by laws which take into
account the age of the system under
consideration.</p>

<p>Let us take a very simple, indeed the
simplest possible, example. If two
hydrogen atoms having just the correct
total energy for the formation of a
hydrogen molecule have approached one
another and combined, the law describing
what has happened must indicate that
at a definite moment the combination
was complete and the process at an end.
This is an example of an irreversible
process, since the molecule does not
<i>spontaneously</i> break up again. Moreover,
the mathematical formulation of this
process must include the definite age
of the system at which the process was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>complete, this age being measured from
some selected initial moment.</p>

<p>This process provides an interesting
limitation to a principle put forward
by Maxwell as the basis of physical
science. He suggested that the laws of
physics must be considered to be eternal
and unchanging and that therefore they
must be expressed in a form which does
not contain the time explicitly. This
means that for physical laws there can
be no difference between to-day and
to-morrow. The laws are concerned with
small changes which systems undergo
in small time intervals, and need not
express any fundamental distinction
between one moment and another.</p>

<p>Such laws cannot express the fact
that anything sudden ever occurs which
makes an essential change in the system
as when two systems become one, or
when one system breaks up into two. The
laws of organic growth or the evolution
of individual systems must display the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>fact that at a certain age of the system
special things happen, such as the combination
of two hydrogen atoms, or the
attainment of maturity by an organism.
Maxwell’s principle puts a limitation on
the form of physical laws which precisely
eliminates the laws that would be appropriate
for organisms. But there is no
reason why a broader physics should
not try to frame this new type of law
that would be applicable to the history
and development of individual systems,
and it is probable that if this could be
done the reversible laws of Newton,
Maxwell, and Einstein would appear as
approximations which were valid when
nothing of special interest was happening,
i.e. when only spatial movements were
involved without synthesis, disintegration
or the emission of light.</p>

<p>Laws of the Newtonian type which
Maxwell had in mind assume that one
can adequately describe the present
state of a system without specifying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>its past history. But we cannot say
anything very precise about the inside
of a living organism, and it is found far
more efficient to describe what is known
of its past history. We do not try to
say where atoms are in an organism;
instead we mention its species, age, etc.
Organisms might be defined as systems
whose future behaviour is more easily
estimated from their past history than
from what can be known about their
immediate internal structure. The most
convenient formulation of organic laws
will therefore be expressed in terms of
the age of the organism and take account
of how its life has been spent. These
laws are necessarily irreversible, since
the assimilation of oxygen or food is
always going on in a manner which can
never be reversed. Life is like a function
which must always alter in one direction;
when this development ceases life has
disappeared.</p>

<p>The contrast of living and dead now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>appears less important than the following
classification of natural processes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Processes which are reversible and
whose laws can be expressed independently
of the age of the system, e.g.
gravitational and mechanical motions
which do not involve light or heat.</p>

<p>2. Processes which are irreversible,
the laws being best expressed in terms
of the total time which has passed since
some initial state, e.g. chemical combination,
growth, evolution, radioactivity,
and all changes involving light or heat.</p>
</div>

<p>Physics has always asserted that
processes of the first type were
fundamental in nature, and astronomy
provided the ideal example in planetary
motion. It was this assertion that gave
rise to the essential issue behind the
conflict of mechanism and vitalism.
But if Born is right, and the fundamental
atomic processes are irreversible, then
the situation is completely altered. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>is no longer a question of life being an
arbitrary irruption in a world of mechanical
law, since the laws of gravitation
and mechanics must then be looked on
as the limiting case, when the irreversibility
is vanishingly small, of a whole
series of irreversible processes which
constitute the most important examples
of the fundamental order in nature.
This series would include the atomic
processes connected with heat, light,
and electricity, chemical combination,
colloidal effects, organic growth and
evolution, and the highly co-ordinated
electrical processes which form the
physiological basis of consciousness.</p>

<p>If this view is correct the atomic
processes of radiation and chemical combination
should be just what the biologist
needs to build up organisms. Instead
of a chaos of little particles obeying
inverse square laws, the modern physicist
offers to the biologist a new kind of atom
with electrical and magnetic properties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>which cause it to build up stable compounds.</p>

<p>The biologist may reply: “Yes, but
organisms have four chief characteristics,
their behaviour is irreversible, and displays
growth, memory, and purposiveness.
If you tell me that your atoms obey
irreversible laws, so much the better,
because my organisms certainly do.
But your crystals grow very differently
from my cells and organisms, and you
can’t explain away the apparent purposiveness
of all life.”</p>

<p>To which the physicist may answer:
“Suppose that two hydrogen atoms are
some distance apart with the total energy
necessary to make a molecule. If they
begin to move towards one another
under some attractive influence which
they exert we display no surprise. But
they are moving towards a final end,
which is an end, even though they are
of course unconscious of it; and provided
that nothing interferes they will reach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>one another, form a molecule, and the
process will be consummated. The
atoms move under an irresistible law of
attraction towards a final condition which
is unavoidable unless outside influences
prevent it. The system of the two atoms
develops necessarily towards a consummation,
and the process has in this
sense a teleological quality, though this
need not mean that any god or man had
consciously planned the end for these
particular hydrogen atoms.</p>

<p>“This quality was not present in
Newton’s law of gravitation precisely
because it failed to say what happens at
the end of any process, for instance
when a meteorite hits the earth. Newtonian
laws avoid the responsibility of
dealing with all the exciting events,
like the wedding of the atoms or the
death of the meteorite. On the other
hand it appears probable that all irreversible
laws can be interpreted as leading
either from or to some critical end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>condition. Thus all heat processes tend
towards an approximate uniformity of
temperature, and chemical reactions also
move towards a final condition.</p>

<p>“Such systems as these display the
rudiments of unconscious purpose. One
must imagine these systems made much
more complex so that it takes a long
time and considerable nourishment before
their unconscious purpose is fulfilled,
whether this be the instinctive reproduction
of their kind or any other
biological function.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. I like the unconscious
purpose which you have revealed in
irreversible physics, because I am troubled
by colleagues who see conscious mind
everywhere.</p>

<p>“But if I grant that your view of the
atom, and hence of molecules and colloids,
allows me two of the four features I
find in life, i.e. irreversibility and
unconscious purpose, you have still to
deal with growth and organic memory.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>
<p>“Yes. Growth and memory are things
that physics has as yet little to say
about. But we have at any rate reduced
the problem of life to smaller proportions.
It is no longer the question what is life?
but, how do colloidal processes build
themselves up into continuously-active,
developing systems which can react
to their surroundings so that some distant
condition can ultimately be attained?
This is a much less difficult question.
Moreover, since the problem of radiation
underlies all the chemical processes which
are associated with the maintenance of
life, we may expect considerable assistance
when physics has cleared up this
crucial problem.”</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Physics and Mind</i></p>


<p>If a psychologist who was not a behaviourist
had been listening to this
conversation he might break in:</p>

<p>“Does the physicist seriously propose
that we should try to leave mind out of
our picture of the human organism?
Even if we can eventually explain the
unconscious purposes of the lower
organisms as ends towards which they
are driven by physical laws, yet man
has the supreme distinction of a conscious
mind, he can select his aim, and
if he likes renounce it again for something
else. You must therefore allow in your
picture for the emergence of mind at
some point during the course of evolution.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>
<p>“Wait a moment,” replies the physicist.
“Your whole outlook towards consciousness
betrays not only an anthropomorphic
standpoint, but one limited to a single
stage in man’s development. There is
no single condition adequately described
by the word ‘conscious’. There are in
fact a great many different states of
awareness which may grade into one
another, or may form a series of distinct
conditions. We do not know much
about them yet, but their variety is most
striking. There is the dim sentience as
we awake from chloroform, the awareness
of the dreaming state, the passive
experiencing that accompanies any intensely
rhythmic activity such as running.
Again, quite different states are known
in day-dreaming, intellectual concentration
and the delicately-balanced semi-consciousness
of creative thought.</p>

<p>“Consider especially the states of
awareness associated with love, or with
the supreme creative activities of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>mind. Free-will, or the deliberate choice
of a purpose, is completely lost in a
whole-natured falling in love, as it is also
in the artist’s need to follow some dimly-conscious
intuition of a task he must
attempt. At these important occasions
free-will disappears before a sense of
inner organic necessity.</p>

<p>“These examples seem to me to make it
clear that ‘conscious purpose’ is not
in any sense the ultimate or highest
criterion of human behaviour, and that
free-will need not be taken necessarily
to mean the power to over-ride any laws
of nature. In my view ‘free-will’ is
simply the apparent characteristic of
organic behaviour when no complete
integration of the personality has been
achieved and the mind seems to be able
to oscillate from one purpose to another.
We really have to deal in human beings
with a whole series of forms of behaviour
of increasing complexity and integration:
reflex and instinctive actions, deliberate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>activity, and finally the intuitive whole-natured
creative functioning which leads
to ends which could not have been intellectually
foreseen. To each of these
must correspond a certain type of awareness,
and in my view, a brain process of
a definite degree of complexity. By
analogy with our own experience of
different modes of consciousness, we may
be able to infer from the structure of the
central nervous system of an organism
what sort of awareness it can experience.</p>

<p>“Eventually we must expect to be able
to give a complete scheme of all organic
behaviour in terms of the organic processes
and their laws, but none the less it will
remain a great deal more convenient in
some cases to refer to what happens to
human beings by using words that
suggest their conscious experience. The
behaviourist denies the scientific significance
of all but the very barest elements
of conscious experience, but of course he
has to start from the human perception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>of light and colour. Science cannot get on
without ideas which obtain their whole
meaning from the qualities of conscious
experience, and hence the extreme
behaviourist position merely arises from
a prejudice which prevents clear thinking.
But as a campaign to put more stress
on the direct observation of what really
happens to living beings in terms of
physical movements, behaviourism can
only do good by bringing more unbiassed
knowledge about life.</p>

<p>“My own interpretation of the question
may be put in this way. The thing that
is given in nature is a process in time.
According to its complexity and degree of
co-ordination an organic process has
different degrees of awareness. There
is no one condition called human consciousness,
because the human organism can
function with different degrees of co-ordination,
and if we ask if an atom in
absorbing light is conscious, the question
has no definite meaning. But in a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>years those who are studying the physiology
of the central nervous system will
be able to indicate how many steps of
synthesis and integration occur between
the simplest cell and the creative thinker,
and to each of these stages will be ascribed
a mode of awareness. But below a certain
degree of organic complexity this ‘awareness’,
will cease to be anything that can
be consciously imagined by man, e.g.
below the dimmest sentience one might
allow an undifferentiated knowledge of
mere continuance, based in turn on the
rhythmic pulsation of the elementary
cells.”</p>

<p>“Your scheme is of course still rather
vague, but in its main outlines it appears
satisfactory”, replies the psychologist.
“But tell me outright, can mind influence
matter? If I understand you rightly,
you suggest that matter certainly influences
mind.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I do not! You
are back at the meaningless questions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>on which philosophers have wasted much
time. To ask if mind can influence
matter does not mean anything until
you know what you mean by mind and
matter, and to a scientist that means
knowing the laws they obey. Now,
on the one hand, relativity and modern
quantum theory indicate that there is
no matter in the old sense of particles
made of some unchanging stuff, and
physical science recognizes atomic
and other <i>processes</i> as fundamental
in the place of ‘matter’. On the other
hand, you really mean by ‘mind’ one
particular form of conscious activity:
the deliberate selection of a purpose.
Therefore to give your question real
meaning I have to ask instead ‘Does
the conscious selection of a purpose alter
the physical processes going on in the
human organism?’</p>

<p>“But that is an absurd question. It
is like asking: Does a dint in the outside
of a hat <i>cause</i> an alteration in the shape
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>of the inside of the hat? To which the
only reply is that the dint on the outside
is merely another way of describing the
dint on the inside. There is no <i>causing</i>
of the one by the other any more than
if you fold a bit of paper you can say that
the crease on one side causes the crease
on the other side. They are identical
and the double method of description
used in the question creates a meaningless
problem.</p>

<p>“‘Conscious selection of a purpose’
is one way of describing a particular
process, and after this process has occurred
the brain will be different from before.
The old theories of the correlation or
interaction of mind and matter presupposed
that they were separate things
in themselves. The important questions
become quite different when one realizes
that mind and matter do not exist
independently, but that they are both
somewhat inadequate ways of describing
certain <i>aspects</i> of one organic process.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>The spatial aspect of organic process
is called the physical organism. The
temporal aspect of organic process corresponds
to the content of its consciousness.
The physical body is a group of spatial
characteristics. Consciousness is a system
of temporal elements; memory, anticipation,
deliberate repetition, creative
longing, hope and fear are all things
set in time.</p>

<p>“Professor Alexander has said ‘Time is
the mind of Space.’ He attempts to
explain space and time by an anthropomorphic
analogy. It is a very
suggestive idea, though for the searcher
whose goal is the nature of consciousness
itself it is more valuable to put it the
other way round: mind is the temporal
aspect of process, body the spatial aspect.
But it is very important indeed to notice
that we have not yet found the adequate
terms for describing these two aspects
of process. Matter is unsatisfactory for
the spatial aspect, because there are no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>unchanging particles. But nor is mind
sufficient for the temporal aspect,
because there is a temporal aspect to the
combination of hydrogen atoms and to
chemical and colloidal processes, and yet
we must not speak of these as having
mind. When the new words for these two
aspects are invented they will form the
foundation of the scientific synthesis which
I am expecting.”</p>

<p>To which the psychologist may answer:
“Well, at heart I have always been a
thorough-going determinist like you, at
least in dealing with my patients. Moreover
I find it works, because I have
always included in my picture of the
patient a life-impulse of some sort, which
can be influenced by my personality.
Thus if the behaviour of my patient is
absolutely determined, the conditions
which determine what happens to him
include some inner life tendency, and also
the effects produced on him by all the
people he meets.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>
<p>“But if one attempts to formulate such
an absolute determinism, or to apply it
to oneself, one gets into deep waters, and
I haven’t the courage to try it. It seems
you must be right at bottom, but that
only a god could believe it without its
upsetting his mental balance or his sense
of moral responsibility.”</p>

<p>“There I agree,” replies the physicist,
“as long as one does not simultaneously
revise one’s whole view of life in terms of
this new organic knowledge. That is a
very big task, but I should like one day
to attempt it. Two things especially would
attract me to such a revision of human
values. One is that people who ought to
know better still go about making moral
judgments about their acquaintances. Now
that we know how profound is the influence
on a child of the treatment it receives
during its first five years of life, moral
judgments become rather old-fashioned
and only show that the person making
them has himself not yet learnt to find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>emotional fulfilment in healthier ways.
An analysis of human behaviour
along the lines of organic determinism
might do something to show that moral
condemnations, whether of bolshevism or
of the sins of one’s children, are never
effective unless immediately accompanied
by positive example or creative
suggestion.</p>

<p>“But there is another more attractive
reason why I should like to attempt this
transvaluation of values. If organic
determinism is valid, then the artist’s
aspiration to create is a natural consequence
of some organic law. Creative
aspiration may then be looked on as the
natural destiny of certain human beings,
though they no more know where they are
going than did the two hydrogen atoms.
But organic determinism allows us to
understand why it is of no importance that
the artist doesn’t know what he is going
to create before he does it. It seems that
in some matters our organic body is wiser
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>than ourselves, or rather wiser than our
very immature consciousness. When we
have developed our consciousness by the
discovery of the organic laws of our own
natures we may be able to make human
life more beautiful.”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>The Future of the Sciences</i></p>


<p>The preceding pages have very broadly
indicated the way in which current physical
researches may influence the scientific
outlook on the problems of matter, life,
and mind. The view has been put forward
that we are on the eve of a profound
scientific synthesis of which the main outlines
are already determined. These
general suggestions will now be made more
precise in order to offer to anyone who
is interested the opportunity of testing
for himself some definite prophecies regarding
the future of scientific thought.
The forecast made here does not involve
any supernatural reading of the future,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>but is based on tendencies already inherent
in the different departments of science.
For convenience it is expressed in the form
of separate assertions concerning the future
of physics, biology, and psychology.</p>

<p>1. Before 1940 a very remarkable simplification
will be made in atomic theory,
which will indicate that in quantum processes
physics has ‘touched bottom’ and
that—for the time being—we may consider
that nature is not infinitely complex
within the heart of the atom. The proof
of this apparent if not absolute limit to
the micro-structure of nature will take the
form of the discovery of simple relationships
between the fundamental constants
of atomic structure, e, m, M, c, and h.
(The electronic charge and mass, the mass
of the hydrogen nucleus, the velocity of
light, and Planck’s constant.) Such
relations are already known but are considered
to be of no significance since they
are ruled out by the accepted theory of
electrical dimensions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>
<p>Yet this dimensional system is not
based on direct observation, and the
importance of these relationships will soon
be recognized in consequence of experiments
aimed at a direct determination of
an ‘electron velocity’, in a curved track.
‘Electron velocity’ as calculated from
deflection experiments will be found not
to be the same as the directly measurable
cms. per sec., and in the case of straight
electron tracks, the measured velocity
may be found to be always that of
light, though this does not mean much
since the velocity of light in one direction
has never been measured.</p>

<p>As the result of the study of individual
radiation tracks, for instance in the reflection
of electrons by crystals, and particularly
of any <i>time</i> measurements that can
be made, a new system of physical conceptions
will be built up appropriate to
irreversible processes, which will be
substituted for the Newtonian reversible
system. The new scheme will probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>be based on the conception of the atom,
with its radiating electron tracks, as a
natural clock which not only can be used
to measure out equal time intervals, but
also to yield an objective criterion of past
and future. In order to make this idea,
or at least one part of it, capable of
empirical test the following hypothesis is
put forward: The time-interval between
any two point-events on any electron
track is a simple function of the length
and curvature of the part of the track
between the two points. This hypothesis
contradicts the current interpretation of
electron theory on a point which has never
yet been subjected to experimental test.</p>

<p>The conceptions which will be built up
on electron velocity experiments will very
quickly bring within one simple theory
the facts of chemical combination and
colloidal processes. For these depend
upon irreversible effects connected with
radiation and electrons, and will therefore
be amenable to treatment by the new conceptions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>for the very reason which necessarily
puts them beyond the scope of
Newtonian laws.</p>

<p>2. As the result of the alteration in
physical conceptions biology will soon
cease to draw a definite line between inanimate
and living systems. The normal
characters of life will be recognized as
appearing in steps as one passes up the
series atom, molecule, colloid, protoplasm,
cell, and through further stages to mammal
and man. In each class of organism a
central controlling process will be discovered
and its laws formulated with some
precision, in terms of irreversible electrochemical
processes. The process which
in each organism represents the co-ordinating
factor and is the life of the organism
considered as a unit may for instance be
described in terms of a quantity which we
shall call ‘f’. ‘f’ would be such that so
long as ‘f’ keeps on increasing the organism
is alive, while if ‘f’ stands still
the organism dies. The rate of increase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>of ‘f’ indicates the tempo or intensity
of the organism’s life. In a simple case
‘f’ might be directly related to the intake
of oxygen or food, and just as respiration
and assimilation are irreversible, so is the
change in ‘f’. ‘f’ must go on increasing,
or else cease to represent any quantity in
nature; as soon as it ceases to increase
the process to which it corresponds cannot
be identified any longer.</p>

<p>The most important factors which influence
the life-function ‘f’ (i.e. which
affect the central controlling process in
any organism) will be known before about
1950, with the result that local rebellions
such as cancer will not only be controllable,
but easily prevented. Harmless methods
for increasing the rate of change of ‘f’,
i.e. for increasing the <i>élan vital</i> of the
organism, will be discovered, so that, for
instance, the duration of child-birth will
be reduced to a natural minimum. If
child-birth sometimes takes very long
nowadays, this is presumably because the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>woman’s body is tired, exhausted, or
partially poisoned by her mode of living,
and by raising her vitality at the critical
moment we may expect to be able to let
the process go on at its natural speed.
There must be some minimum time necessary
for the act, since a vast number of
complex organic processes have to complete
themselves in a certain order, but
probably this time is considerably shorter
than that during which many women in
this country have to suffer.</p>

<p>It is already known that the Mendelian
<i>genes</i> which determine heredity are related
to the rates of development of special
processes in the organism, and a control
over the life-tempo, or rate of increase
of ‘f’ in any organism or group of cells
within an organism, will provide a new
method of tackling the practical problem
of heredity. It is possible that hereditary
tendencies to specific weakness or disease
will be overcome by accelerating or retarding
the rate of development of the human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>system at some special moment between
conception and maturity.</p>

<p>Rejuvenation will soon be safe and
efficient, but not as a means for attempting
immortality. It will be socially recognized
as healthy and legitimate only when
undertaken to compensate for premature
ageing due to specific repressions, illness,
or anxiety.</p>

<p>The elimination of known diseases by
a genuine science of life does not mean
that other diseases will spring up perhaps
worse than before. A theoretical science
of life will know the meaning of all disease,
and will not prevent one in such a
way as to give rise to another. Instead of
making campaigns against influenza or
any other one disease, it will determine
the conditions in which no disease can survive,
and thus gradually eliminate all the
organic diseases which attack the body.</p>

<p>But this does not mean the attainment
of a hygienic Utopia in which human life
necessarily fulfils itself. A balance will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>made to the disappearance of cancer and
syphilis, not by the arising of other
diseases but as a result of the consequent
increase in the sensitiveness of the human
brain.</p>

<p>The supremely difficult task of the next
hundred years will be to keep the mind
of the race healthy and stable through a
period of critical sensitiveness. We are
in a transition stage of violent instability,
of intense cruelty coupled with compassion
(America), of blended love of
liberty and need of discipline, of emotional
religions and of wars—but we must hope
that it will lead to some mode of life with
greater inherent stability.</p>

<p>3. Psychology is now occupied with the
discovery that the human response to
perceptions is not additive, i.e. that the
effect made by a group of sounds or
colours depends on the pattern in space
and time in which they are arranged.
(<i>Gestalt-theorie.</i>) For instance, the effect
made on a man by the individual notes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>of ‘God save the King’ when played in
the wrong order is negligible, and bears no
relation to his response when he hears the
tune played in a cinema, and it reminds
him of ‘patriotism’ and the War. So far
no scientific method has been found of
describing when a group of elements is to
be treated as a ‘whole’ for the purposes
of psychology, and this is where the greatest
advances may be expected.</p>

<p>Most scientific conceptions have been
based on the method of spatial analysis,
i.e. the reduction, where possible, of a thing
to its smallest spatial elements. Physics,
biology, and psychology have all lacked
the equipment to describe what makes
the atom, organism, or the pattern
function as a unit, and how we are to
know if some group is a unit or not. The
analytical method is fully developed,
but we lack even the basis for a synthetic
treatment. This leads some hard-headed
scientists of the materialistic school who
will ‘stand no nonsense’ to assert that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>there is no such thing as ‘synthesis’,
that this is a mystical idea left over from
primitive anthropomorphism. Yet to
any mind that is guided not by prejudice
but by a simple search for truth, the fact
of synthesis is obvious, though not yet
properly formulated.</p>

<p>Here modern physics can supply a
clue. Analysis is the method required in
a search for instantaneous spatial structure;
the synthetic method which we
need must deal with the temporal history
and behaviour of systems. The fact that
the human being reacts in the ways he
does to a tune as a whole is evidence of
something in his history, that he has heard
the tune often under certain emotional
surroundings. The unity of any synthesis,
whole, or organism is not an instantaneous
fact explicable in terms of structure, for
we can recognize this unity only from a
continued observation over a period of
time.</p>

<p>Physics can invent one law to describe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>the approach of the two hydrogen atoms
to form a molecule, and in doing so treats
the two together as a unit. This suggests
that the fact of organic unity is to be
defined and formulated in terms of an
irreversible law which governs the system
as a whole. Thus a group of atoms, cells,
or any other elements is to be called a
unit when, and only when, one irreversible
law can be found which expresses the
behaviour of the different elements as
contributing towards some common end,
like the formation of the molecule in the
case of the hydrogen atoms.</p>

<p>We can now draw a practical conclusion
for the future of psychology,
which is in great need of a moral
principle to guide its treatment of
disintegrated human personality. On
the analogy of the two atoms, a human
being is to be considered as a unity when
his whole behaviour displays continuous
co-ordination towards some end. But
there is an important difference in the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>cases: the atoms move towards an end
which we know because it has already
happened in history, whereas man’s
development is creative, that is it
proceeds towards an end we cannot
know exactly before it comes into being.
Thus the parent or psychologist need
not trouble if he cannot understand what
his child or subject is aiming towards:
so long as some consistency and harmony
of functioning is apparent, the ‘end’
can be left to nature to look after, because
such harmony <i>means</i> that the organism is
tending towards some ultimate condition.</p>

<p>The psychologists of the future will
therefore have to follow some principle
such as this: their only legitimate
aim is the maintenance and restoration
of harmonious co-ordination of all the
human functions, and no concern need
be paid to ultimate intellectual or spiritual
ideals. Of course if the person considered
is apparently tending towards some
degenerate condition, that is known to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>the onlooker because it is <i>not</i> new but a
repetition of what many human beings
have done before, then this tendency
can be altered. At least, it can be altered
if the onlooker can use his intuition to
discover signs of repressed conflict which
show that the immediate tendency is
not whole-natured, but based on the
repression of some more profound aspiration
or desire. Then by bringing this
repressed aspiration back into consciousness
the degenerate tendency may be
arrested. But this control over the lives
of others can only be effectively exercised
by the intuitive discovery that their present
tendencies are not whole-natured.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Prophecy can never be scientific, and
forecasting in the realm of science is
perhaps the most dangerous form of
intellectual acrobatics. Science must be
thorough, and all vague speculation is
its enemy. But there are moments when
a profound revision is necessary, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>amidst the responsibilities and rich appeal
of daily life no one will undertake this
task who does not believe that it offers
an adequate reward to science and to
man. To-day prophecy can call attention
to unjustified limitations inherent in
current scientific thought, and encourage
the students of matter and of life to get
together and try to discover the single
system of natural law which we must
believe covers both realms. It may
even help them to find crucial experiments
by which to guide their search.</p>

<p>The reward is certainly great. The
indifference to the destruction of life
which has marked recent years is no
cause either for surprise or for despair
after an epoch of orthodox and insincere
religion coupled with an abstract science
of matter. One thing only can guide
humanity to a saner and richer life:
the recognition and valuation of life.
This can be assisted by science and art
both revealing life in all its significant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>forms. But the roots of art have been
destroyed by the domination of a science
which had not recognized the significance
of life within the realm of natural law.
For great art can only arise from a
profound reverence for life, whereas to
the scientific mood of this period life
appeared as an arbitrary impulse in
continual conflict with the laws of matter.</p>

<p>Physics is now studying light. The
radiant influence of light nourishes life
and within human body forms the fabric
of consciousness. We are alive and
conscious, but our consciousness is
immature for we do not yet know the
laws that govern our own lives and
thoughts. Yet it is certain that light,
life, and consciousness are bound together
by some undiscovered law. This
secret of nature’s alchemy is still hidden
from us within our own bodies. By
revealing it physics will create a new
hope for man.</p>

idea in an essay in <i>Science, Religion, and
Reality</i>, 1925. See also Weyl, <i>Was ist Materie?</i>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> E.g. the irreversible motion of an electron
in the field of a bar magnet is rendered formally
reversible by the assumption that the magnetic
field is due to moving electrons. Yet this
assumption is highly artificial since it postulates
electronic movements that have never been
observed. In other cases irreversibility is
eliminated by the choice of special co-ordinate
systems. Some physicists now hold the view
that irreversibility may be inherent in atomic
as it is in organic processes.</p>

<p>It may be convenient here to summarize
the processes that give at any rate superficial
evidence of their irreversibility: processes
involving heat changes, or the radiation of
light, or mass; the production of energy in a
star, the motions of electrons in magnetic fields,
certain types of atom-ion collision in mixed
gases, processes dependent on retarded potentials,
radioactivity, organic growth and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>evolution, and consciousness itself. Eddington
deals only with the case of the emission and
absorption of light, but suggests that the
direction of time can only be deduced from
statistical processes. This is the orthodox view,
though it is very doubtful if it is valid now that
the quantum processes are receiving formulation.
In this connection, see note 4.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> The idea that time may be an active

time-differential found convenient for the
correlation of a standard clock with a reversible
process which is being observed.
A law whose mathematical formulation
involves ‘t’ measured from some moment in
the history of the system, gives an entirely
new meaning to ‘t’, though one consistent
with the properties of the reversible Newtonian
differential ‘dt’. Such a law may claim to express
the fact of historic, irreversible, duration,
a feature in nature which is neglected by laws
involving only ‘dt’ squared.</p>

<p>This series of books, by some of the
most distinguished English thinkers,
scientists, philosophers, doctors, critics,
and artists, was at once recognized
as a noteworthy event. Written from
various points of view, one book frequently
opposing the argument of another, they
provide the reader with a stimulating
survey of the most modern thought in
many departments of life. Several
volumes are devoted to the future trend
of Civilization, conceived as a whole;
while others deal with particular provinces.
It is interesting to see in these
neat little volumes, issued at a low price,
the revival of a form of literature, the
Pamphlet, which has been in disuse for
many years.</p>
